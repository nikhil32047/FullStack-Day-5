Day 5:
========

1) Frozenset Data Type
==============================
A frozenset is an immutable version of a set.
It contains unique elements like a set.
Supports operations like union, intersection, difference.
Cannot add or remove elements.
Useful when you need a set as a dictionary key or store in other sets.

Example:
fs = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 3])
print(fs)          # frozenset({1,2,3})
print(fs.union({4}))  


2) Range Data Type
=========================
range() represents a sequence of numbers, often used in loops. It does not create a list in memory — it generates values on demand (memory efficient).
Syntax: range(start, stop, step)
Default start = 0
Default step = 1

Example:
r = range(1, 5)
for i in r:
    print(i)   # 1 2 3 4


3) None Data Type
=========================
None represents the absence of a value.
It is a special constant.
Used to show “no value”, “not assigned”, or “empty return”.

Type: NoneType

Example:
x = None
print(x)          # None
print(type(x))    # <class 'NoneType'>
